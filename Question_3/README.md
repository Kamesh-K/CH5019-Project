### Question 3

##### Approach for the Question 3:

- COVID-19 Dataset from Kaggle - SRK dataset
- Visualize the data to understand the data and answer the questions mentioned 
- Add suitable columns to the dataset and filter to answer the questions
- Plot on number of cases and try to fit a curve through the same 
- To comment on the how successful the lockdown is we can fit a curve through the days before 21 days and compare it with the actual curve -- This maybe mislead as the data can be very small and the curve fitting may give a very wrong understanding. Any other suitable methods is welcomed!
